    "notes": "Prices are 2024 annual averages from ISO market monitor reports. ERCOT, SPP, and ISO-NE are day-ahead averages; MISO and PJM are real-time load-weighted averages; CAISO and NYISO are estimated from available reports. DA prices are typically $1–3/MWh higher than RT. Capacity additions are gross nameplate MW reaching commercial operation in 2024 (not net of retirements). Queue completion rates span 2000–2020 entry cohorts from LBNL Queued Up and Brattle/AEU Scorecard; ERCOT uses a narrower 2018–2020 cohort. Project counts are distinct generators (EIA-860M unit-level) reaching COD in 2024. All-in prices add capacity market payments (RPM, FCA, ICAP, RA, PRA) to energy-only wholesale averages."
