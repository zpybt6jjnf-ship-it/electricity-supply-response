    "notes": "Prices are 2024 annual averages from ISO market monitor reports. ERCOT, SPP, and ISO-NE are day-ahead averages; MISO and PJM are real-time load-weighted averages; CAISO and NYISO are estimated from available reports. DA prices are typically $1–3/MWh higher than RT. Capacity additions are gross nameplate MW reaching commercial operation in 2024, sourced from EIA-860M January 2026 vintage (not net of retirements). Industry sources report higher figures for some ISOs — see filing-lag notes. Queue completion rates span 2000–2020 entry cohorts from LBNL Queued Up and Brattle/AEU Scorecard; ERCOT uses a narrower 2018–2020 cohort. Project counts are distinct generators (EIA-860M unit-level) reaching COD in 2024. All-in prices add capacity market payments (RPM, FCA, ICAP, RA, PRA) to energy-only wholesale averages."
