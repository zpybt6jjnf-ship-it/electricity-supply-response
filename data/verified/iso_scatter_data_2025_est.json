Prices: ERCOT $37.57 and SPP $37.91 from EIA STEO monthly; CAISO ~$35 from DMM quarterly reports; NYISO and ISO-NE ~$55 from Potomac Economics/ISO Newswire (winter gas spikes). PJM BRA 2025/26 at $269.92/MW-day (~$18/MWh adder, 9× increase). MISO PRA at $217/MW-day annualized (~$9/MWh adder, 10× increase). Capacity: ERCOT 11 GW from Modo Energy; CAISO 5.7 GW from Year in Review; others estimated proportionally to 2024."
